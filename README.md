## Synopsis
**LASSIE** is a statistical model for inferring selection coefficients associated with coding variants in the human genome. Details of the **LASSIE** model are available on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/13/441337).

## Precomputed **LASSIE** scores

Precomputed **LASSIE** scores (selection coefficients) are available for all potential coding variants in the human genome (hg19 assembly):
